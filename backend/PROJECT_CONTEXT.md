# 🧠 Project Handoff Context: Eduverse LMS Backend

## 📌 Project Overview

Eduverse is a Learning Management System (LMS) built with **Go (Gin Framework)** and **GORM**. The system uses a multi-school architecture where users can belong to one or more schools.

## 🏗️ Architectural Patterns (Strictly Follow These)

1.  **Layered Architecture**:
    - `domain`: DB models and TableName definitions.
    - `dto`: Request/Response structures (JSON).
    - `repository`: Raw GORM queries.
    - `service`: Business logic, validation, and cross-service coordination.
    - `handler`: HTTP request parsing and DTO mapping.

2.  **ID vs Code Convention**:
    - **Internal (DB)**: Use UUID for all Primary and Foreign Keys.
    - **External (URL)**: Use `schoolCode` or `subjectCode` in API paths for human-readability.
    - **Converter**: Always use `schoolService.ConvertCodeToID(code)` in the Service layer to translate codes to internal IDs.
    - **Route Pattern (Option A)**:
      - Default detail: `/:id` (UUID).
      - List by parent: `/school/:schoolCode`.
      - Detail by code: `/school/:schoolCode/:subjectCode`.

3.  **Data Integrity & Error Handling**:
    - Repositories **MUST** check `RowsAffected == 0` on Update/Delete/Patch and return `gorm.ErrRecordNotFound` if no row was modified.
    - **Standardized Error Masking**: All handlers **MUST** use `HandleError(c, err)` for service/DB errors and `HandleBindingError(c, err)` for JSON binding/validation. This prevents leaking raw database details (like column names or constraint names) to the client.
    - Centralized error logic is located in `internal/handler/error_handler.go`.

4.  **API Standards**:
    - Standardized `SchoolHeaderDTO` (ID, Name, Code, Logo) or `ClassHeaderDTO` used across all modules when returning school/class context in list responses.
    - Use `Preload` in Repositories to ensure related data (like Creator names or School info) is included in responses.
    - All activation/deactivation actions use the `PATCH` method.

5.  **Material & Assignment Integration**:
    - Both `Material` and `Assignment` belong to `SubjectClass` (using `mat_scl_id` and `asg_scl_id`), not directly to `Class`. This ensures they are linked to a specific subject and teacher within a class.
    - **Upsert Logic**: Submissions and Assessments **MUST** use upsert logic (update if existing for the same user/assignment) to prevent duplicate record accumulation.

## 🔐 Security

- Passwords are hashed using **Bcrypt**.
- RBAC system is implemented: `User` -> `SchoolUser` -> `UserRole` -> `Role` (Global Roles).
- Permissions have been removed in favor of Pure RBAC (Role-based access checks).
- _Note: Auth middleware (JWT) is NOT yet implemented._

## 📂 Documentation

Full API specs are available in `backend/docs/api/`. Refer to these files before changing any endpoint behavior.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Info

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase).
- **Env**: Managed via `.env` (loaded in `main.go`).
- **Build**: Run `go build ./...` to verify all modules.
