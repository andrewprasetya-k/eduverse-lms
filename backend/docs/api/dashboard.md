## Key Features

### Real-time Calculations
All metrics are calculated in real-time from the database:
- No caching required
- Always up-to-date data
- Efficient SQL queries with proper joins

### Role-based Views
Each dashboard is tailored to the user's role:
- **Student**: Focus on personal progress and deadlines
- **Teacher**: Focus on grading workload and class performance
- **Admin**: Focus on school-wide statistics and trends

### Performance Optimized
- Uses aggregated queries to minimize database load
- Limits on list results (e.g., top 5 deadlines, last 10 activities)
- Indexed columns for fast lookups

## Usage Examples

### Student checking their dashboard
```bash
GET /api/dashboard/student/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
# Parameter: userId (usr_id from users table)
```

### Teacher viewing pending reviews
```bash
GET /api/dashboard/teacher/223e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
# Parameter: schoolUserId (scu_id from school_users table)
```

### Admin monitoring school statistics

## Notes

- **Authentication Required**: These endpoints should be protected with JWT middleware
- **Authorization**: Ensure users can only access their own dashboard (or admin can access school dashboard)
- **Caching**: Consider adding Redis caching for admin dashboard if school is large
- **Pagination**: Currently returns fixed limits (5 deadlines, 10 activities). Can be made configurable.
