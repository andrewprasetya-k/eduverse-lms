## 🔑 Key Features

### Pagination
Most list endpoints support:
- `?page=1` - Page number (default: 1)
- `?limit=20` - Items per page (default: varies)
- `?search=keyword` - Search filter

### Response Patterns
- **Header Pattern**: List responses include parent context (School, Class, SubjectClass)
- **Soft Delete**: Most delete operations are soft deletes (can be restored)
- **Upsert Logic**: Submissions and assessments auto-update if already exist

### File Handling
- **Multipart Upload**: Direct file upload with auto-detection
- **Metadata Only**: Record already-uploaded files (Supabase/S3)
- **Inline Media**: Create media records within material/assignment creation

### Error Handling
- Standardized error responses (no raw DB errors exposed)
- Validation errors with field-specific messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
